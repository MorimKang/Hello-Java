	 <h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2> <br><br>
      When Alice follows the White Rabbit down a rabbit hole, 
      she finds herself in a land where she can change her size. 
      She meets a Duchess with a pig for a baby, a Cook that throws spoons, 
      a wise but mad Cheshire cat, the March Hare, Mad Hatter and a Dormouse. 
      A Caterpillar shows her how to adjust her height by eating from the right 
      and left sides of a mushroom.
